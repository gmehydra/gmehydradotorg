        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" target="_blank">The fediverse</a> represents the next
            evolution of community-based social media. The fediverse is a social network made up of a collection of thousands of servers running open-source software that can communicate with each other across common protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary advantage offered by the fediverse is that it allows any individual or group to be their own social media provider while also connecting them to the larger community of fediverse participants.

        <div class="generic-title">Descriptions of Social Media Models</div>
        <div class="header">Centralized</div>
        <p>
            Centralized social media models such as Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, etc., are the most
            common and familiar types of social media on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this context, the defining aspect of centralized models is that there is a single central authority
            at the top of the structure with ultimate control over the entire network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Centralized models work for most people most of the time, but, because ultimate authority is always in
            the
            centralized control of the platform owners and never with the community, this imbalance of power can
            create circumstances where opposing interests between the community participants and the platform owners results in censorship.
        </p>
        <div class="header">Decentralized</div>
        <p>
            Due to this fundamental weakness with centralized models, various attempts have been made to create a
            solution that could be described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization"
                target="_blank">decentralized</a>, with one of the main ideas being that more
            decentralization
            creates more resistance to censorship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the word decentralized can be ambiguous but in this context it would mean a network of
            software nodes (aka servers)
            interacting with similar such nodes that operate autonomously without any human intervention at all.
            This is the definition that is typically used in the context of cryptocurrency.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>
            are two examples of networks that meet this description, but these networks are cryptocurrency networks
            and not social media networks.<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            While some attempts have been made at decentralized social media, it is a challenging problem for such
            products to be functionally decentralized while also being a tool that is effortlessly useable and
            appealing.
        </p>

        <div class="header">Federated</div>
        <p>
            Somewhere in between centralized and decentralized exists <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)" target="_blank">federated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A federation is a group of computing or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a
            collective fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a federated network, there are aspects that are centralized and aspects that
            are decentralized.
            While a federated network is not a fully decentralized social media solution, it is a mostly decentralized social media solution.
